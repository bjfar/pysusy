20 Feb 2013 - Getting weird errors in <>-.timing output file, occasional rows
cut off and new ones begun. Pretty sure this is a result of multiple processes
writing to the file simultaneously. Only way to fix this would be to implement
a file locking system, or use mpi to send all timing output to (say) process 0 
for writing to file. This is a pain to do, but should try to get around to it
sometime. For the moment my analysis tools are designed to just skip such
errornous lines, and they are rare so it isn't really a problem. Doesn't seem
to be a problem with txt files or anything, but they are written by multinest
so presumably it does something similar to the solution I described.
